# 1:1 Program

The [1:1 program](https://southland.institute/1_1.html) by the Southland Institute is an opportunity to curate a term of in-depth, personal study composed of individual dialogs with speakers, lecturers, course and workshop leaders who have contributed to the actualization of the Southland Institute's first five years.

## ./ (root) Project & The 1:1 ( 2:2, 2:1)

We like to think of 1:1 as a nursery for the project ./ (root), as a space to work on the seedlings ( researchs ) in the cloud until they reach a stage where they can be transplanted into the ground.

Here you can see the [application](root.cddwmpl.org) we made for the 1:1 Program.

Now as the appointments progress one after the other, we see the program as the first implementation of the ./ project (root) and if we were to situate ourselves in the protocol, we estimate that we are at the data localisation phase. 

Thus we envisage, after formatting the data, a restitution presenting objects resulting from the discussions during the meetings, the documentation and the presentation of the objects which compose the server. 

Ideas of formats in bulk : 

* What happen if everyhting is highlighted in blue ? 
* The choreography of the request.
* Shell Script performance
* Make a local area network server workshop 
* Sharing a meal trhough the ocean


### The meetings

Some meeting notes are archived ( sometimes messy ) on a [figjam space](https://www.figma.com/file/ahbbf5tnLJh5ZRJnHA9Tj5/.%2F-root-path?node-id=120%3A529) for the moment.
